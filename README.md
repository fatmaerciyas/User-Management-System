# User Management System
User management system, which is the last question of the Quiz to join the Fill Labs team. The system basically works based on CRUD operations. When the program runs, the person running it can see all users in the database and add new users. Can change the information of an existing user and delete the user.This program has been developed within one week, with Go on the backend and TypeScript with React & Next.js on the frontend. The goal was to be able to create a REST API in a programming language unfamiliar to me within this one-week timeframe.
## Install and Run 
You can easily download the project from GitHub. After downloading the project, open two terminals on your computer, one for the client and one for the server. Then, to run the server side, navigate to the server folder in your terminal and execute the command ``` go run mainGin.go ``` This command will run the mainGin.go file. SQLite database is used in the project, and if you want to see the changes in the data on the server side, you can also open the file with the .db extension under the database folder.
To run the client, navigate to the user-management project in your terminal. Since the React project is created with Vite, you need to execute the command ``` npm run dev ``` After running the command, click on the link displayed in the terminal and enjoy the project :)
